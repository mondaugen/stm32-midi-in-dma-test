To use the 4N35 Optocoupler, the source load resistance must be around 100
ohms or else it seems that the switching time is too long (maybe?). In any
case it didn't work with the value of 220 ohms that the MIDI Spec. gives. You
also need to drive the input to the UARTrx pin with 5V instead of 3V. 
With the 6N138 you can probably respect the values the MIDI Spec. gives.
This is just for my own purposes, in production I should use the 6N138.

UPDATE: SEPT 24th, 2014

The 4N35 seems to work sporatically, I've switched to the *4N36* with better
results. Best to eventually get the proper part.
